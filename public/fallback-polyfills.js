API version 1 has been decommissioned. Your request is being redirected to v2.  The `libVersion` and `gated` query string parameters are no longer supported and if present have been removed from your request.

A deprecation period for v1 existed between August and December 2015, during which time v1 requests were honoured but a deprecation warning was added to output.
